		<h2> Further info </h2>
		<p> The above map shows the hazard for ground shaking across the city of Seattle, WA. The surface wave frequency being mapped is 1 cycle per second (the frequency most dangerous to buildings of 10 stories and taller) with a 10% probability of exceedence (statistical metric describing the probability that a particular value will be met or exceeded) within the next 50 years.
		<br>
	 	Seattle is host to two different types of fault. You can find out what type of fault each one is classified as by clicking on the fault line. </p>
